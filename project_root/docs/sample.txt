Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative models. 

It enables a language model to provide answers based not only on its internal knowledge but also on external sources. This improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

RAG typically involves:
1. Document loading and chunking.
2. Embedding and indexing.
3. Query-based retrieval.
4. Context-aware generation using an LLM.
